This directory contains files to implement a program
that two files as input:
- a  file Ath.fna which contains a DNA sequence, and 
- a file REBASE.txt taken from 
  ftp://ftp.neb.com/pub/rebase/bionet.301
  containing description Restriction fragments.
The program parses both files and asks the user for a name of 
a restriction fragment. If the name is valid, then the regexp
corresponding to the fragment is search for in the DNA sequence,
and all matching positions are reported.

The program relies on code in ../lib which can be accessed
via the option -I, see run.sh

README:		this file
REBASE.txt:		the file containing the restriction enzymes
parseREBASE.py:	a perl module containing functions to parse REBASE.txt
restriction.py:		the main program which puts all together.
run.sh:		a shell script running perl with the appropriate options
Ath.fna:	the DNA sequence file

The code is adapted from the following Book:
Beginning Perl for Bioinformatics, James Tisdall, O'Reilly, 2001
